# NodeModulesSweeper

`NodeModulesSweeper` is a simple tool designed to help developers quickly locate and delete `node_modules` directories from their projects. This can be especially useful for freeing up space, as `node_modules` directories often consume a significant amount of storage.

## Features

- Scan a specified directory or the current directory for `node_modules`.
- Interactive CLI for selecting which `node_modules` directories to delete.
- Option to delete all found `node_modules` directories at once.
